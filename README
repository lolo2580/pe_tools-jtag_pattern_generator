				SECTION I
Revision History:
1.0. Oct 19, 2015 - Initial Release
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
				SECTION II
Description:
This program converts a jtag svf input file to a stil pattern output file.
All svf commands are supported exept for the following:
	PIO
	PIOMAP
The following commands are implemented, but not fully compliant to SVF.
	RUNTEST 
		- it doesnt support SCK.
		- in the  first form, it only checks if run_count can be completed within the min/max limits. If not it wont run at all. Not including min/max time assumes that limits are not required.
		- in the second form, it doesnt run the min/max time limits. It only calculate the average of the min/max, then run it using the average value
	STATE
		- it may not follow the state transition required/recommended/recommended.
	TRST
		- HIGHZ is of no use.	 

A sample output file (jtag.stil) is available on this directory, generated from jtag.sv using the following command line:
./JtagPatGen.exe -if jtag.svf -of jtag.stil -debug -repeat ON

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
			SECTION III
To compile:
	Just type make.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
			SECTION IV
TODO:
	1. Implement not supported (or not fully compliant commands) in Section II.	
	2. Improve error messages.
	3. Support other tester output format.
	4. Maybe add hw support, ie connect microcontroller to the USB, then let it execute the svf commands.
